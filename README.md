# âœ‹ Anonymous Blocking Task
This is the monorepo for the Opal Anonymous Backend Integration code task.

The monorepo contains a Node server and a React client.

To setup each part, follow the instructions in the relative READMEs.

- [Node server README](server/README.md) 
- [React client README](client/README.md)

The server accepts requests via a REST API to set sessions and schedules for a user, and the React client displays the current blocking state, and is updated via websockets.
